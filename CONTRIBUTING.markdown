Before contributing to this project, consider:

- Browsing [the issue tracker](https://github.com/HeladoDeBrownie/Nexus/issues), which summarizes what work needs to be done. In particular, to get a feel for the goals of the project, [the Roadmap label](https://github.com/HeladoDeBrownie/Nexus/issues?q=label%3ARoadmap) is a good place to start.
- Reading [the license](LICENSE), which will apply to any work you submit.
- Opening an issue to say hi and ask what's a good place to start! The issue tracker isn't just for things that would be considered bugs. You can also comment on an issue saying you'd like to take it.

We also have a Discord server. Ask in the issues and I will give you an invite. (For safety reasons, there is no longstanding infinite-use public invite.)
